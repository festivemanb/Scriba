<p>There was once a collection of dirt which had an idea. That idea was me. That dirt was me. The water was me. The sky was me. My eyes were open and the light was me. And the world was me. But in the end it was all dirt, and all it could ever be was dirt, and there probably wouldn't be so much pain and darkness if I didn't keep on expecting it to be anything more than dirt. And one day the air will leave me, and the water will leave me, and maybe the light will leave me too, and the me will leave me, and I will be dirt again. My hands will become dust. My eyes will grow dim. My sides and flesh will sink into the earth. And no one will care. Or, the number of people who could care are just a rounding error of the universe.</p>
